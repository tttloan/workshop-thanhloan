#### Objectives

Integrate user authentication into the frontend to control access and issue valid tokens.

#### Overview

Cognito provides User Pools to manage users and App Clients to issue access tokens. This is the standard authentication layer for frontends in the AWS architecture.

#### Brief Explanation

- **User Pool**: A repository for user accounts, password policies, and permission groups.
- **App Client**: Configuration for the frontend application to receive tokens after login.

#### Required Frontend Environment Variables

1. COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: User Pool identifier.
2. COGNITO_CLIENT_ID: App Client identifier.
3. COGNITO_REGION: Deployment region for Cognito.

#### Verify Login/Logout and Token

1. Perform login and logout on the UI to check session status.
2. Verify the returned tokens (ID/Access token) and confirm that API calls have valid Authorization.
