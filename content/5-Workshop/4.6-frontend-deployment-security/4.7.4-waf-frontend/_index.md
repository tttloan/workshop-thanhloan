#### Objectives

Protect the frontend layer (CloudFront) using WAF.

#### Manage Amplify-Created WAF

When deploying an application using AWS Amplify, a Web ACL (WAF) is usually automatically created and attached to your frontend's CloudFront Distribution.

<!-- #### Note

1. Always prioritize enabling monitor mode (Count) first, combine it with reviewing CloudWatch logs, before switching to full blocking mode (Block) if necessary to avoid disrupting valid users. -->
